# The-Doomsday-Algorithm

## README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains an application and its background code. It is based on an algorithm through which one can tell the day of any given date. This algorithm is called The Doomsday Algorithm. A copy of a webpage from [Time and Date.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/doomsday-weekday.html) is also present in the repository. This webpage explains about this algorithm and also has links to other similar pages. 

[Program.vb](https://github.com/MetaryaBaid/The-Doomsday-Algorithm/blob/master/Program.vb) contains the VB code of the latest version of the aplication.
[The Doomsday Algorithm v1.1](https://github.com/MetaryaBaid/The-Doomsday-Algorithm/tree/master/The%20Doomsday%20Algorithm%20v1.1) contains the version 1.1 of the application and related files.
The [TheDoomsdayAlgorithm.sln](https://github.com/MetaryaBaid/The-Doomsday-Algorithm/blob/master/TheDoomsdayAlgorithm.sln) is the VisualStudio solution file.
The [TheDoomsdayAlgorithm.vbproj](https://github.com/MetaryaBaid/The-Doomsday-Algorithm/blob/master/TheDoomsdayAlgorithm.vbproj) is the Project file.

This application is a VB.NET based console application developed in VS2019.
